# Flight Instruments

## Pitot/Static Instruments
### Airspeed Indicator

Tries to figure out just the ram air pressure
less accurate at higher altitudes and temperatures
Fed by the pitot tube
- Takes in both ram air pressure and static air pressure
Compares two different pressures


### Vertical Airspeed indicator
Tells you if you're climbing or descending
Calibrated leak goes into the casing

### Altimiter
Anaroid wafer stack expands and contracts
29.92 standard at sea level


## Pitot/Static System Errors

|     | Airspeed | Altimiter | Vertical Speed |
| --- | -------- | --------- | -------------- |
| Front of pitot blocked, static clear ||||
| Front and drain of pitot blocked||||
| Pitot clear, static blocked ||||


## Gyroscopic Instruments
Ther's an engine driven vacuum pump moving gyroscopes in the system

### Rigitity in Space
As long as a gyroscope is spinning, it will be able to stay in a "fixed" position


## Heading indicator
Gimbal rotation

The airplane is spinning around the 


## Gyroscopic procession
Why do we care about this in the instruments

## Turn Coordinator
Candted Gyro

Operates from electrical power
The ball is just from gravity in fluid

Skid is tokyo drifting, you can end up in a spin
On base to final you sometimes encourage a skid
Also taking off and turning crosswind is when you'll spin

## Magnetic Compass

True north and magnetic north -> Magnetic variation

UNOS
Undershoot north, overshoot south

ANDS
Accellerate North Decelerate South


Magnetic deviation
The metal in the plane interferes with the metal in the compass

Airplanes have a compass card that 


## VOR
Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range
VOR Station

After "Tuning in a VOR" You can fingure out where in relation to the VOR you are

Pulsing and Sweeping signal

## Course Deviation Indicator

If you did dual VOR navication you'd ude two CDIs

You get the VOR frequencies from your chart

### Errors

Scalping - it will swing back and forth. you can still use it by averaging the center of where it's swinging

The US has a VOR "minimum operational network" where you could 

You can use DME for measuring distance from a VOR
