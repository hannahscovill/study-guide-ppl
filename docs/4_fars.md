R - radio lisence. Go to the FSDO and certify you speak english
O - Operating Limitations. POH

Maintained to regulation requirements

Airframe, engine and propeller logbook

.409
AVIATES
100h inspection

.417
Maintenance records

.503

AVIATES

Annual: 12 calendat months - due the last day of that month
VOR: 30 days if IFR
1: if it's for hire, it needs a 100h inspection. You have a 10h "grace period". If you overfly that by like 5h, you have to do the next one at 95h, but you need a ferry permit that says its safe to fly.
ADs: Airworthiness Directives - docs for any faults in the airplane the maker has issued. They might be one-time. Some are also one-time ADs. These can't be overflown.
Transponder: 24 calendar months - don't need for VFR - only if it's been in use.
ELT - emergency locator transmitter. 12 calendar months OR 50% bettery life OR 1h of cummulative use. You can fly up to 50 NM without an ELT AND it has to be a flight training flight.
Pitot/Static: 24 calendar months


STC??


.205
A TOMATO FLAMES

FLAPS - fuses, something..?



Taking the test - you usually get one major miss and 2-3 little ones

.213

## NTSB
