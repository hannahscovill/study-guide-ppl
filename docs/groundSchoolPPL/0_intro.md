# Twin Oaks Ground School

The following pages are my notes I started when I took PPL Ground school at Twin Oaks, led by CFI's Gabriel Gouaux and Nick Wymetalek.

## Attending the Next Ground School

The ground school focuses on all aspects of the respective licensing, but mainly focuses on the oral portion of the checkride, working through the ACS line by line from lesson to lesson.

The PPL ground school is ten lessons from 6-8pm PT Tuesdays, spanning eleven weeks for a break the week of Thanksgiving, with the last lesson being a group mock checkride. Lessons will be held in the hangar classroom with a virtual recorded Zoom option, so don't worry about not being able to make it to every lesson. 

To sign up for the next cohort, contact Gabe & Nick at [rosecityaviation@gmail.com](mailto:rosecityaviation@gmail.com?subject=Twin%20Oaks%20Ground%20School&body=Hi%20Gabe%20and%20Nick,%20please%20let%20me%20know%20when%20the%20next%20ground%20school%20is%20happening.%20I'd%20love%20to%20sign%20up!%20✨%20Your%20Name%20✨)
