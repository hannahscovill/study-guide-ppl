Dimensions, Restrictions, and weather restrictions

ADSB - flight tracking

Work with your instructor to have your own personal minimums

## Class A

High altitude
PPL cannot enter class A
FAA wants to reset altimiter every 100mi, flight follow will give you one every 25mi
Must be IFR


## Class B
Upside down tirred cake, but not always a circle. Seattle is a trapezoid
only 25 in all of the country
Only the busiest of busiest airports 

250kts inside
200kts limits outside

mode c veil requires ADSB
Mode c transponder (within 30nm, up to 10,000ft MSL)
Mode C: altitude reporting

ATC clearance required to enter

Most have landing fees

Mode C

Tiers are variable based on airport
1 - 0-1100
2. 

Most B airports don't allow student pilots
You need a spec

Clearance is only for 

## Class C

Busy airports, big airports, but now busy enough to be a B

Always circular

Two layers

Still need ADSB, still need transponder
Need 2 way radio

If you 

Tower only cares about 

Trachon is spreading the work across the different controllers
Approach controllers
Tower controllers
Ground controllers

Weather:
152

## Class D
7S3 is 170 MSL

2500 AGL
4NM

Two way radio
Contact ATC before entering
Maintain contact with ATC
Max speed of 200kts inside the airspace

Weather minimums
3152

## Class E

Everything else - but a layer
Sometimes the floor cuts through echo

Starts at 1200 agl


To be VFR, you must be
3152:
3 miles of visibility
1000 above clouds
500 below clounds
2000 horizontal from clouds


If you're above 10,000ft MSL,
5111
5 
1 
1
1 mile horizontal

above 10000, you need adsb and mode c transponder

## Class G

Below E

1 SM visibility
clear of clouds (as close as you can get)

at night it's 3152


It's more restrictive because usually the traffic moves a lot faster


Portland metro area has class 3 starting at 700 AGL

Restrictions
No communication requirement
No instrument requirements

## Special use airspace

Prohibited Areas
  - Flight is prohibited
  - Blue fencing
  - usually small

Restricted Areas
  - Access requires permission, probably

Warning Areas

Military Operating Areas (MOA)
  - Foreflight will show these at glowing red

controlled Firing Areas:

Alert area
- Includes like practice areas


## Additional Airspace
1. Military Training Routes
    - Routes for low-level high speed trainings
    - With 4 digits - means lower, 3 digits means higher
2. Temporary flight restrictions (TFR)
    - Can pop up for reasons, are usually timed
    - Includes:
        - where the president goes
        - stadium
        - forest fire
        - Airshows
3. Terminal Radar Service Area (TRSA)
    - 
4. National Security Areas

## Special VFR
Allows you to fly close to clouds in worse weather than normal VFR

You have to ask for it

You can get SVFR for B-E airspace, but some airspace doesn't allow it at all. i.e. PDX

## Sectional Markings

Magenta is uncontrolled
Blue is controlled


--

When you try to turn a comm radio below 118 it circles around. Anything below 118 is a navigation frequency

A flight service station is for information. You can

Blue line with dots is a wildlife refuge
They want you flying 2000AGL over there to avoid disturbing the wildlife

Pilot controleld lights
- 3,5,7 low,medium,high

Flag is VFR reporting point
