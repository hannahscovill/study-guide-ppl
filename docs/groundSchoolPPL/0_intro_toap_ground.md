# Twin Oaks Ground School

The following pages are my notes I started when I took PPL Ground school at Twin Oaks, led by CFIs Gabriel Gouaux and Nick Wymetalek.

## Upcoming Classes

The ground school focuses on all aspects of the respective licensing, mainly focusing on the oral portion of the checkride working through the ACS line-by-line. You can review the [syllabus](../../static/private-pilot-ground-school-5.pdf) used for class.

The upcoming PPL ground school runs for ten lessons, Tuesday evenings from 6–8pm PT, beginning October 21st. The course spans eleven weeks to allow a break for Thanksgiving. The final class is a group mock checkride.

Lessons are held in the Twin Oaks hangar classroom, with a live, recorded Zoom option for your review or if you can’t attend in person.

To sign up for the next cohort, contact Gabe & Nick at [rosecityaviation@gmail.com](mailto:rosecityaviation@gmail.com?subject=Twin%20Oaks%20Ground%20School&body=Hi%20Gabe%20and%20Nick,%0D%0A%0D%0A%0D%0AI'm%20in%20for%20ground%20school%20starting%20October.%20See%20you%20then!%0D%0A%0D%0A-or-%0D%0A%0D%0APlease%20let%20me%20know%20when%20the%20next%20ground%20school%20is%20happening.%20I'd%20love%20to%20sign%20up!%0D%0A%0D%0A✨%20Your%20Name%20✨)
