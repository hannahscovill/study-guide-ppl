# Performance and Weight & Balance


Datum is the leading edge of the wing

CG is center of gravity. Axis point for pitch and yaw


## Arm

In front of firewal is 1, behind the firewall is positive. Somethign might say -74 from 

Baggage

## Moment

How much force is being exerted


## Other Definitions

- CG limits
- Station
- Basic Empty Weight
- Maximum Gross Weight
- Useful Load

Low ledded gas is 6lb/gal
Jet A, Jet A1: 6.8lb/gal
Jet B - 6.5


## Excessive Weight

- Higher Takeoff Speed
Longer takeoff run
reduced rate of climb and angle of climb
Lower max altitude
Shorter range
Reduced cruise speed
Reduced matuverability
Higher stall speed
higher approach and Landing speeds
Longer landing roll
Excessive weight on the nose wheeel or tail wheel

## Stability

Forward CG required higher angle of attack
Aft CG is usually better cruise performance because you have a lower AOA which creates less drag

## W&B Information

Determined by the manufacturer
When you remove items from the plane, do you have to do anything else? (Update the weight and balance)

## Methods of Calculation

##

## Structure of atmosphere

78% Nitrogen
Oxygen
Carbon dioxide


## Atmospheric Pressure

Standard pressure is 29.92 "Hg

1" is 1000


Elevation at 7S3 is 170ft above sea level

-90ft

Take the difference

## Density Altitude

Density altitude is the altitude equivalent 


standard temperature is 15C or 59F
You'll have to calculate density altitude 

Make a chart about high density altitude == bad,
high density == good
low density == bad


Calculat etakeoff distances

## Performance Speeds

True Airspeed TAS
Indicated Airspeed IAS
Calibrated airspeed CAS
Equivalent Airspeed EAS
VS₀ - stall in flaps (landing config)
VS₁ - Stall speed in specified config
Vy best rate of climb
Vx best climb angle
Vle landing gear extension speed
Vlo - 
Vfe - flap extended speed (white arc)
Va - manuvering speed
Vno - maxiumum structural cruising speed (smooth air only)
Vne - never exceed - red line
