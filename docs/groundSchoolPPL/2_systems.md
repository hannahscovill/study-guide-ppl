## Primary Flight Controls

How the airplane controls the movement around the different axis

### Alierons
Turn the airplane by changing the chord lines opposite from each other

### Elevator
Kicks the tail up or down

### Rudder
For adverse yaw

## Secondary Flight Controls

### Trim
Poor Man's Autopilot
You can have trim on any of the controls.

There's manual trim on small planes that's made

If you want the elevator down, the trim tab will move up


### Flaps
This slide is tiny

Basic section
Plain flaps (RV)
Split flap
Slotted flowler flap
Slotted flap


### Spoilers
To counteract adverse yaw

## Propeller
It looks twisted because needs to take more of a "bite" from the air closer to the nose because it's moving more slowly

The faster the edge of the propeller is traveling, the more drag it's producing
Big planes add blades instead of longer propellers because the edges approach the speed of sound and get much less efficient

## Powerplant
Engine!!
All the Cesnas at Twin Oaks:
- 4 cylander
- horizontally opposed
- naturally aspirated - breathing natrual air, (not spooled, more compressed air)
- air cooled - fins with more surface area for the air to naturally cool it down

### Four Stroke Cycle
Intake
Compression
Combusion
Exhaust

### Detonation and Preignition
Rather than combusting in the powerstroke, it's just exploding (during the compression stroke) (because the piston isn't moving)

Preignition - the spark plugs light the fuel on the intake cycle


### Induction System
How does the air and the fuel get into the engine?

#### Carburated engines
Venturi draws air and fuel and atomizes it together
There's a needle that 

Do you still have induction on fuel injected engines

Any time you reduce the throttle, you "pull the carb heat out" to put heat on the carb to prevent icing

Ice can form in
- the butterfly valve
- the venturi because it's creating a low pressure (cooler) system



#### Fuel Injected engines
You have an electrical system that's keeping the same ratio of fuel to air

The injector does the atomizing of the fuel electronically
They can have a vapor lock

RVs have a FADAK ??

### Ignition Sysyem
Magneto is a self contained (from other electrical systems) magnetic field
There's a ball that spins around in it
There's a spring in it - when you start, it uses

Each magneto connects to one of the spark plugs in each cylanger

If a magneto failed, you'd not really be able to climb. You'd probably drop around 4000 RPM

### Oil System

Wet sump system
There's oil sitting at the bottom of the crankcase, the crankshaft dips into the pool then flings it all over the engine
It doesn't froth as long as it isn't over full


Dry sump system
Oil is stored in a sperate resivor and pumped through the engine
Scavange pump
Oil cooler

### Cooling
RV is air and liquid cooled

Shock cooling is a thing - causes cracks in the engine

### Exhaust
The hot air has to go somewhere or it can't intake more air

MANIFOLD, NOT SHROUD
Goes trhough a heat shroud  - it's a cabin and carburator heater. If there's a crack in the shroud you can get CO poisioning. You'll get light headed

Exhaust gas is over 1000 degrees

### Starter System
You have to turn on the master switch (the battery) before you can start the engine

### Electrical System
The electrical system digram is in the POH

Buses are like power strips that power multiple components coming from it.

14v or 28v system with 12v or 24v batteries

The RVs have lanes that are generators, not alternators
Casnas have alternators, not generators

(alternators efficiant at low RPMs, generators are worse, they produce)

The RV has no magnetos, It has a backup EMS battery

The master switch turns on both the battery and alternator at the same time

You can turn off radios, lights, anything electrical you can


## Landing Gear
Tricycle

Castering nose wheel - rudder also turns the wheels

Tailwheels - bush flying

Lubscome tail wheel planes

## Hydraulics
Shimmy dampener - some are air
Olwheel strut
Brakes


#### Scenarios

1
You have a p-lead When you turn a magneto off and don't see a drop in rpms
If it doesn't drop, it means that the right mag isn't grounded and it's notturning off when it's supposed to


2
High CHT, low EGT could mean detonation

You would definitely hear that, right?
If the engine starts banging, it could be other things, but it would be accomanied by the

Enrich the mixture, lower the rpm, decent to cool the engine
