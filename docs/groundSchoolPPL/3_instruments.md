## Pitot/Static Instruments
### Airspeed Indicator

Tries to figure out just the ram air pressure
less accurate at higher altitudes and temperatures
Fed by the pitot tube
- Takes in both ram air pressure and static air pressure
Compares two different pressures

"Calibrated leak"

If you lea


### Vertical Airspeed indicator
Tells you if you're climbing or descending
Calibrated leak goes into the casing

### Altimiter
Anaroid wafer stack expands and contracts
29.92 standard at sea level


## Pitot/Static System Errors

|     | Airspeed | Altimiter | Vertical Speed |
| --- | -------- | --------- | -------------- |
| Front of pitot blocked, static clear ||||
| Front and drain of pitot blocked||||
| Pitot clear, static blocked ||||


## Gyroscopic Instruments
Ther's an engine driven vacuum pump moving gyroscopes in the system

### Rigitity in Space
As long as a gyroscope is spinning, it will be able to stay in a "fixed" position


## Heading indicator
Gimbal rotation

The airplane is spinning around the 


## Gyroscopic procession
Why do we care about this in the instruments

## Turn Coordinator
Candted Gyro

Operates from electrical power
The ball is just from gravity in fluid

Skid is tokyo drifting, you can end up in a spin
On base to final you sometimes encourage a skid
Also taking off and turning crosswind is when you'll spin

Uses rigity in space

## Magnetic Compass

True north and magnetic north -> Magnetic variation

UNOS
Undershoot north, overshoot south

ANDS
Accellerate North Decelerate South


Magnetic deviation
The metal in the plane interferes with the metal in the compass

Airplanes have a compass card that 


## VOR
Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range
VOR Station

After "Tuning in a VOR" You can fingure out where in relation to the VOR you are

Pulsing and Sweeping signal

## Course Deviation Indicator

If you did dual VOR navigation you'd ude two CDIs

You get the VOR frequencies from your chart

Turn the OBS knob to change the heading, tune in your CDI through OBS

### Errors

Scalping - it will swing back and forth. you can still use it by averaging the center of where it's swinging

The US has a VOR "minimum operational network" where you could 

You can use DME for measuring distance from a VOR


### Distance Measuring Equipment
DME measures distance in slant range distance
Not good at it's job when you're close and high. Accurate when you're low and far away

Do we need to know more than abode?


A VOR _has_ DME most of the time if it has DME at all. twin oakes planes have GPS instead of DME

### Horizontal Situation Indicator HSI
Usually wont have the analog version of this in most (Twin Oaks) cesnas
The cesnas have a G5


### Electronic instruments

Combines your entire 6pack into one instrument

## magnetometer
Heading comes from magnetometer - located in the tail, the wing or in cesnas the strut. It measures the change in the flow of an electronic current

## Air Data computer
rv12s
448
35H

Those iwthout an air temperature probe uses ... something else. Without the probe it cant calculate true airspeed

## Attitude and Headeing Reference System
Combination of magnitometer, accelerometer and a fake gyroscope
In the g5s it

Air inertia sensor ..??
