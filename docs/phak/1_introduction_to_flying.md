## Advisory Circulars (ACs)

Information the FAA wants to publish that hasn't made it into their other official publications yet

## Notices to Airmen (NOTAMS)

Was briefly Notice to Air Missions but switched back to Notices to Airmen

More urgent than Advisory Circulars

## Practical Test

The [Practical Test Standards](https://www.faa.gov/training_testing/testing/test_standards) (PTS) were the main certification guidance for DPEs before the FAA enhanced them by coming out with the [Airman Certification Standards](https://www.faa.gov/training_testing/testing/acs) (ACS)

The Sport Pilot practical test uses PTS and PPL uses ACS
