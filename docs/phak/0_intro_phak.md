# Book Club

Our student-led gorup is covering The Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge (available for free on the [FAA's Website](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/phak)). The PDFs for each indivudual chapter and the audiobook are linked on each page.

The pages that follow are intended to be somewhere in between a quick reference, study guide, supplemental guide and Cliff's Notes for the book.

## Tips for Reading
It's pretty dense reading! Taking notes will probably help a lot. This [Acronyms & Initialisms](/acronyms) page helped me.

## Book Club Meetings

The club meets weekly on Wednesday nights from 6-8pm PT in person at [Twin Oaks Airpark](https://www.flytwinoaks.com/). If you'd like to join remotely or participate asynchronously, please let the host know to add a virtual meeting in the comments of your [RSVP](#join-us).

- Don't worry if you didn't quite finish the reading.
- Each chapter seems somewhat/fairly self-contained. It would be great to have you join even if you're finding us after we've started.

### Meeting Format (Evolving)

- Intro & check-in
  - What brings you here?
  - Where are you in your aviation journey?
