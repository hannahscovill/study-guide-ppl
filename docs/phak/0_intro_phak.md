# Book Club

[RSVP](#join-us)

![Book Club Flyer, blue background with two drawn airplanes and their wingtip vorticies drawn. This flyer says the book club is on Wednesday nights October 1 through December 3 at Twin Oaks Airpark and will cover 1 or 2 chapters each week](../../src/pages/short.png)

Our student-led gorup is covering The Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge (available for free on the [FAA's Website](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/phak)). The PDFs for each indivudual chapter and the audiobook are linked on each page.

The pages that follow are intended to be somewhere in between a quick reference, study guide, supplemental guide and Cliff's Notes for the book.

## Tips for Reading
It's pretty dense reading! Taking notes will probably help a lot. This [Acronyms & Initialisms](/acronyms) page helped me.

I also found it helpful to listen to a podcast after the reading to hear the subject matter more colloquially. The [Flying New Guy](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG_hxiQ49vKXnmtK4oh-o5j4Fg5Dbp_Dr) from Pilot Institute has been great for this.

## Book Club Meetings

The club meets weekly on Wednesday nights from 6-8pm PT in person at [Twin Oaks Airpark](https://www.flytwinoaks.com/). If you'd like to join remotely or participate asynchronously, please let the host know to add a virtual meeting in the comments of your [RSVP](#join-us).

- Don't worry if you didn't quite finish the reading.
- Each chapter seems somewhat/fairly self-contained. It would be great to have you join even if you're finding us after we've started.

### Meeting Format (Evolving)

- Intro & check-in
  - What brings you here?
  - Where are you in your aviation journey?
  - What would you like to get out of the group?
- Down to business
  - The reading
    - Agenda items collected ahead of the meeting
    - Speed run the chapters - look at the heading titles & figures to jog memories for discussion topics
    - Discuss key takeaways, questions, etc.
    - Share notes
  - Sporty's Quiz as a group on the topics from the reading -or- a relevant activity (Navlog, airport sign flash cards)
- Time permitting:
  - Did anyone come across something aviation related and cool?
  - What's on your flight training docket?
  - Any aviation events coming up?
