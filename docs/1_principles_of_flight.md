# Principles of Flight

Leading Edge, Upper Camber, Mean Camber, Trailing Edge
Lower Camber Chord ("C" in the lift equation)
L=CL * SA * .5P * V

CL: Angle of Attack: Angle between the chord line and the relative wind
- If the plane is level and falling straight down, the AOA would be 90 degrees

SA: Flaps

P: Atmospheric pressure

V: Airspeed



### Forces in Flight
Thrust, Drag, Lift, Weight
thrust is only greater than drag when accelerating.

- Thrust
	- propellers
	- Gliders generate thrust through pointing the nose down

- Drag
	- Parasitic
		- Lowest when going slow, highest when going fast
		- Skin friction drag
			- Rivets instead of screws
		- Form drag
			- Sleek shape instead of city bus
	- Induced
		- Byproduct of lift - the wingtip vortices
	- Total
	- Glide speed is the bottom of the drag curve. the most distance for the least
	- Bernoullis Principal
		- If you move something through a fluid really fast it will create less drag
		- Equal time transient theory has been disproven
- Weight
	- Always right in the direction of gravitational pull
- Lift


- Stability - the aircraft's tendency after a change is applied
	- Positive Static Stability
		- Push forward on the yoke and let go, it will dip and correct, then the next dip will be smaller
	- Neutral Static Stability
		- Push forward on the yoke and let go, it will keep going down at the same angle
	- Negative Static Stability
		- Push forward on the yoke and let go, it will increase the downward angle

	- Longitudinal Stability
		- stability from the nose to tail
		- The axis it pivots around is the lateral
	- Lateral Stability
		- Pivots around the longitudinal axis
		- Most wings take a dihedral shape so when banked, the lower wind  naturally creates more lift and brings the aircraft back to
		- Swept back wing/keel effect
	- All axis, longitudinal

Airfoil designs
- Rectangle
	- Cheap, safe
- Elliptical
	- Cheap, stall at the same time
- Sweptback
	- Generally less safe but better performance at higher speeds
- Pointed tip
- Moderate taper
- High taper

Less of the vortex is created when the wing is thinner (the chord is shorter)

Adverse yaw
- The reason we have rudders - to coordinate turns
- When you turn the yoke

Why do big aircraft have big spoilers instead of correcting more with a rudder

Stalls happen in the critical angle of attack, when inadequate lift is being generated. Stall can happen at any airspeed.

### Turning Tendencies
Forces that create a yaw
- Spiraling slipstream
	- The faster you get, the lower frequency the coil
- Torque
	- When the propeller turns, because of equal and opposite forces, it's trying to turn the airplane in the opposite direction
	- Does that cause enough unequal stress that they have to reinforce?
- P Factor
	- Higher at slow airspeed and high AOA
	- Lower at high
	- One side of the propeller is doing more work than the other side of the propeller 
- Gyroscopic procession
	- it's only when you're lifting the nose up or pushing it down
	- The propeller is a gyroscope - it 
	- If you push on a gyroscope, the pressure of the push isn't in full effect until a 90 degree turn has happened


Wingtip Vortices
- High pressure air escapes to the top of the wing

Wake Turbulence
- Wingtip vortices - a much larger airplane can create a very dangerous wake
- What's the worst for wake turbulence
	- Right (or left?) quartering tailwind
		- Why right instead of tailwind?

Ground effect
- Reduction of induced drag - because the vortices can't form because the ground is in the way

Slow Flight
- Maintaining altitude while slowing down
- Produce a lot of lift, produces a lot of drag, then you need more thrust to overcome it so you maintain altitude

Region of Reverse Command *They wanted to cover it again*
- The area behind the power curve behind the best glide
- Which side of the power curve are you on

Slips
- Forward Slip
	- Use aileron 
- Side Slip
	- For landing in crosswind
