# Principles of Flight

Leading Edge, Upper Camber, Mean Camber, Trailing Edge
Lower Camber Chord ("C" in the lift equation)

L=CL * SA * .5P * V

L: Lift

CL: Angle of Attack: Angle between the chord line and the relative wind
- If the plane is level and falling straight down, the AOA would be 90 degrees

SA: Flaps

P: Atmospheric pressure

V: Airspeed



### Forces in Flight
Thrust, Drag, Lift, Weight
thrust is only greater than drag when accelerating.

- Thrust
	- propellers
	- Gliders generate thrust through pointing the nose down

- Drag
	- Parasitic: Highest at high speeds
		- Lowest when going slow, highest when going fast
		- Skin friction drag
			- Rivets instead of screws
		- Form drag
			- Sleek shape instead of city bus
		- Interference drag
	- Induced: highest at low speed
		- Byproduct of lift - the wingtip vortices
	- Total
	- Glide speed is the bottom of the drag curve. the most distance for the least
	- Bernoullis Principal
		- If you move something through a fluid really fast it will create less drag
		- Equal time transient theory has been disproven
- Weight
	- Always right in the direction of gravitational pull
- Lift


- Stability - the aircraft's tendency after a change is applied
	- Positive Static Stability
		- Push forward on the yoke and let go, it will dip and correct, then the next dip will be smaller
	- Neutral Static Stability
		- Push forward on the yoke and let go, it will keep going down at the same angle
	- Negative Static Stability
		- Push forward on the yoke and let go, it will increase the downward angle

	- Longitudinal Stability
		- stability from the nose to tail
		- The axis it pivots around is the lateral
	- Lateral Stability
		- Pivots around the longitudinal axis
		- Most wings take a dihedral shape so when banked, the lower wind  naturally creates more lift and brings the aircraft back to
		- Swept back wing/keel effect
	- All axis, longitudinal

Airfoil designs
- Rectangle
	- Cheap, safe
- Elliptical
	- Cheap, stall at the same time
- Sweptback
	- Generally less safe but better performance at higher speeds
- Pointed tip
- Moderate taper
- High taper

Less of the vortex is created when the wing is thinner (the chord is shorter)

Adverse yaw
- The reason we have rudders - to coordinate turns
- When you turn the yoke

Why do big aircraft have big spoilers instead of correcting more with a rudder

Stalls happen in the critical angle of attack, when inadequate lift is being generated. Stall can happen at any airspeed.

### Turning Tendencies
Forces that create a yaw
- Spiraling slipstream
	- The faster you get, the lower frequency the coil
- Torque
	- When the propeller turns, because of equal and opposite forces, it's trying to turn the airplane in the opposite direction
	- Does that cause enough unequal stress that they have to reinforce?
- P Factor
	- Higher at slow airspeed and high AOA
	- Lower at high
	- One side of the propeller is doing more work than the other side of the propeller 
- Gyroscopic procession
	- it's only when you're lifting the nose up or pushing it down
	- The propeller is a gyroscope - it 
	- If you push on a gyroscope, the pressure of the push isn't in full effect until a 90 degree turn has happened


Wingtip Vortices
- High pressure air escapes to the top of the wing

Wake Turbulence
- Wingtip vortices - a much larger airplane can create a very dangerous wake
- What's the worst for wake turbulence
	- Right (or left?) quartering tailwind
		- Why right instead of tailwind?

Ground effect
- Reduction of induced drag - because the vortices can't form because the ground is in the way
It's half of your wingspan or the length of one wing.
Low wing airplanes can land more smoothly because they enter ground effect sooner in their descent.

Slow Flight
- Maintaining altitude while slowing down
- Produce a lot of lift, produces a lot of drag, then you need more thrust to overcome it so you maintain altitude

Region of Reverse Command *They wanted to cover it again*
- The area behind the power curve behind the best glide
- Which side of the power curve are you on

Slips
- Forward Slip
	- Use aileron 
- Side Slip
	- For landing in crosswind


## Recap


The motion through the air itself if relative wind
** Review the difference between AOA and relative wind

Angle of attack is the relationship between the chord line of the wing and the relative wind


induced
Paracitic
skin friction drag is paracitic

INTERFERENCE DRAG: Air splitting and meeting back together
The disturbance is greatest at two planes meeting each other

When you're going fast, the skin 

Adverse yaw is when one wing creates more lift than the other, meaning it also creates more drag and causes your node to veer off to the side

You have to add power in a steep turn because lift is not as vertical so you have to compensate with more thrust

When does an airplane stall? The textbook answer is "When you exceed your critical angle of attack."

Va is stall the plane before you break the plane
Vx is something else

The lighter you are, the lower the Va
A g5 (is that wit the color arcs?)

Wake turbulance is the worst at Lifting off. Happens when you're heavy, clean and slow
