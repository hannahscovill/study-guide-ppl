# Acronyms & Initialisms

I sometimes got lost while reading the PHAK and had to go back several pages to find where it was defined. Hope this helps!

Related: The PHAK also has a [glossary](https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/21_phak_glossary.pdf) of terms. It doesn't have all the acronyms and initialisms though
